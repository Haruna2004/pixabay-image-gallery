## Reflection

  - This was a week long project built during a youtube session with (Brad Traversy)[https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia] of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  
  - One issue I faced was working with outdated npm packages and old configurations
  - What were some unexpected obstacles?
  - At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux,  a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app`.
